>>> Q1 <<<
 Test specifications are iterative, generative blueprints of test design.
They are written at the item level, and allow test developers or item
writers to produce new versions of a test for different test-taking
populations. The specs serve as guidelines so that new versions can be
compared to previous versions.

>>> Q2 <<<
 A Test Execution is an issue type that aggregates a user-determined
collection of Tests. It monitors and verifies if those Tests are 
working as expected in a target context and environment.

>>> Q3 <<<
 Test record a phonograph record containing recordings of various
tones of accurately controlled frequency and intensity and used 
for testing phonographs and pickups.

>>> Q4 <<<
 Test Completion is the last stage of the software testing life
cycle. It results in a report that is a Test manager or a Test
lead prepares that showcases the completed data from the test execution.

>>> Q5 <<<
 The activities of testing can be divided into the following basic steps:
	Planning and Control.
	Analysis and Design.
	Implementation and Execution.
	Evaluating exit criteria and Reporting.
	Test Closure activities.

>>> Q6 <<<
 Test analysis has the following major tasks:
	Reviewing the test basis (such as requirements, architecture, design, interfaces).
	Evaluating testability of the test basis and test objects.
	Identifying and prioritizing test conditions based on analysis of test items, the specification.
	Behavior and structure.
	Designing and prioritizing test cases.
	Identifying necessary test data to support the test conditions and test cases.
	Designing the test environment set-up and identifying any required infrastructure and tools.

>>> Q7 <<<
 The fundamental test process consists of the following main activities:
	Planning and Control.
	Analysis and Design.
	Implementation and execution.
	Evaluating exit criteria and reporting.
	Test closure activities.

>>> Q8 <<<
 Test implementation and execution has the following major tasks:
	Developing implementing and prioritizing test cases.
	Developing and prioritizing test procedures, creating test data and, optionally, preparing test harness and writing automated test scripts.
	Creating test suits from the test procedures for efficient test execution.
	Verifying that the test environment has been set up correctly.
	Executing test procedures, either manually or by using test execution tools, according to the plane sequence.
	Logging the outcome of test execution and recording the identities and versions of the software under test, test tools and test ware.
	Comparing actual results with expected results.
	Reporting discrepancies as included and analyzing them in order to establish their cause.
